        ### Dataset Information
        This application utilizes the **PlantVillage dataset**, a comprehensive collection of plant leaf images for training machine learning models to identify various plant diseases.

        **Key features of the dataset:**
        - **Extensive Collection:** Over 87,000 RGB images of plant leaves.
        - **Diverse Classes:** 38 categories representing diseased and healthy plants.
        - **Data Split:** 80% training, 20% validation, and a separate test set with 33 images.
        - **Image Augmentation:** Offline augmentation enhances generalization.
